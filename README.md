## CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK IN C

The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional, and general, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in C. This project is inspired by the following work: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html

This is by no means an easy task; however, as someone stubborn who refuses to take libraries for granted and swears by writing his own C code, it is a task I am willing to take on. Any suggestions, comments, criticisms, are welcome
